'''Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so
that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and
blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue,
respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]'''

def sortColors(nums):
    low = 0
    mid = 0
    high = len(nums) - 1

    while mid <= high:
        if nums[mid] == 0:
            nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif nums[mid] == 1:
            mid += 1
        else:  # nums[mid] == 2
            nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
            high -= 1

# Example
nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
sortColors(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
